## Miguel Cabrera - RF - *81*

The 2004 Breakout Card holds 74 Power against right-handers, 75 Power against lefties and a solid 85 Contact against righties. Those numbers may seem average but this card rakes. You can also put him at 3B if you're comfortable with his 62 fielder rating. That 2004 season, while not as good as his 2005 campaign, the 21-year-old Cabrera tallied 112 RBI, scored 101 runs and batted .294 with 33 homers.

## Carlos Gonzalez - CF - *90*

With solid vision of 63, speed of 73 and contact of no less than 94 from either left or right-handed pitching, the left-handed outfielder is an easy card to get your hands on. There are a couple MLBTheShow20 Moments that may take several attempts, but this card is definitely worth your time.

## Cody Allen - CP - *88*

Only attainable by collecting all of the live series Indians cards, the 2016 Cody Allen Playoff Card has a pitching repertoire consisting of a 95 MPH 4-seam, a slow, hard-breaking knuckle-curve and a changeup of 88 MPH.

The attributes on the former closer for Cleveland include 3 fire bars with H/9 of 106, K/9 of 113 and 108 pitching clutch. That year in the postseason, Allen recorded 6 saves with 24 strikeouts and surrendered just 8 hits while holding a 0.00 ERA over 13.2 innings.

## David Ortiz - 1B - *86*

Do you enjoy hitting bombs? If so, Big Papi is your guy in the Diamond Choice Pack if you pre-ordered the game or at Level 60 in the XP Reward Path; the card can also be purchased in the Community Market. The 2003 Breakout Card holds a 86 overall rating and absolutely smashes right-handed pitching. You'll likely want to bench the retired slugger against opposing lefties considering his below average Contact and Power is less than 60 in both attributes. During his 2003 season, Ortiz knocked in 101 RBI, 39 doubles and 31 bombs with a popping .961 OPS.
